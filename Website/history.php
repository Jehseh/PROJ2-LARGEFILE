                                <p>Maybe like some of you, I play a lot of AAA games made by Ubisoft, Valve, Blizzard, etc.
                                    and I wondered, </p>

                                </p>
                                <p>Of course, as a Filipino myself, it’s a good feeling to know that a video game was made in
                                    the Philippines. Because of that, I am willing to support these Philippine made video
                                    games. </p>
                                <p>Maybe I got your attention, and you are also wondering the same thing.</p>
                                <p>I did a little research and have found some games for you.</p>

                                                    <p>Because of that, entry of promising independent video game developers received very
                                                        little attention from mainstream media and the government. This goes through
                                                        Tantra Online developed by ABS-CBN Entertainment. With it being a Massive Multiplayer

                                                        Gamers lacked interest in Tantra Online, resulting to a small player base and, in turn, slowly dwindled

                                                and magical product that is literally five years ahead of any other mobile phone".
                                                A year later, Google's G1 was released with the Android Operating System. Their
                                                touchscreen feature has led to the development of many apps on their platform
                                                through Apple's App Store and Google's Play Store. This made Smartphones a possible

                                                    Ondoy (Hurricane Ketsana) last year. We believe that volunteerism is an effective
                                                    way of tackling big problems, and we wanted to encourage this throughout the
